### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Bhavin Yardi, a Graduate Mechanical Engineering student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.


With a passion for solving complex problems through a blend of computational precision and practical application, I focus on creating solutions that strike the right balance between engineering rigor and real-world efficiency.


My technical foundation spans CAD modeling, CFD simulations, performance analysis, and design validation workflows, supported by extensive research experience that bridges analytical theory with experimental insight.


Over the course of my journey, Iâ€™ve worked on projects in product development and testing, tool development, and project management - experiences shaped by my role as a CFD Intern at Ansys, a researcher at the MiNDS lab and a Cost Engineer at ExxonMobil
